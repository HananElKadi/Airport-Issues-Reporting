### Work Done

- Taking a screenshot for the image after finishing editing and replace it with the old image so i don't need to save strokes and redraw them each time and at the same time i can post the image to the ai analyser with the edits
- changing displaying details to read only
- changing the image slider to grid slider
- splitting the camera logic from the createissue component into an independent component

### What I Learned

- Rasterization : wich is a concept in image graphics where i can convert drawing sticker ...into actual pixel colors
- i use the concept of rasterization here using react-native-view-shot so i take a screenshot of the whole image after finishing editing so the edits be pixels of the image and no more strokes overlaping the image

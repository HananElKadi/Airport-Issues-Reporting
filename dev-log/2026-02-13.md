### Work Done

- Building a model that take my image, send it to the model with a prompt , validate the response comming from my model so it's structured well and finally sending response back via api

### What I Learned

- I should convert images from bytes to str to send it to the ai model
- Building an agent is not too hard
- I should not change the place of my react native project because it may confused node modules

### Issues / Confusions

- Changing the path of my react-native project cause an error and need rebuild and re installing for node modules

### Bugs

- All bugs have been fixed properly ^=^

### Achievements

- Finalising my Assessment and everything is working properly

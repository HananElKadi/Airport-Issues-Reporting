### Work Done

- Implemented a Drawer navigator and wrapped the Stack navigator within it.
- Built a global search bar capable of querying across all issues.
- Implemented memoized filtering using selectors to efficiently combine search and filter criteria.

### What I Learned

- How `createSelector` works and why memoization improves performance in larger datasets.
- Navigation architecture (Stack + Drawer) and techniques for customizing the drawer UI and behavior.

### Issues / Confusions

- How to trigger opening the drawer from a specific screen using a header button.
- How to support multi-select filters for a single field.
- Concern about relying heavily on Claude for UI design instead of developing independent design skills.

### Bugs

- No bugs

### Achievements

- Completed the search and filtering system with a solid understanding .

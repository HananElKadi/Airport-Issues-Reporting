### Work Done

* Fetched mock data from FastAPI backend.
* Displayed backend data inside a React Native modal.
* Connected React Native mobile app to FastAPI server.
* Implemented image upload from mobile → backend successfully.

### What I Learned

* Basic Pydantic validation (request/response models).
* Pydantic Types and validation 
* The files will be uploaded as "form data"
* Backend layering concept:

  * Transport layer (API routes)
  * Service layer (business logic)
  * Persistence layer (storage/data handling)

### Issues / Confusions

* Backend responses are slow even AI agent not yet integrated into the flow.

### Bugs

* No breaking issues encountered today.

### Fixes / Achievements

* Solved mobile ↔ backend communication.
* Fixed file upload handling (multipart/form-data) and verified images arrive correctly to FastAPI.
* Implementic the response BaseModel using pydantic
